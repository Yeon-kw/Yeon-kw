### About me
Hi👋I'm Dayeon Gwak, a **Frontend developer** living in South Korea. 
I'm a student at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, about to graduate in February 2026.
I'm studying to become a front-end developer starting June 2025.  
I majored in *Japanese Interpreting* and *Software&AI*, and have been working as a Korean-Japanese interpreter.  

More recently, I've been focusing on learning the technologies used in Frontend development.

I have a lot of hobbies, including drawing, watching anime, reading novels, and playing games.  
I want to be a developer who touches people's lives one day. 🌟
